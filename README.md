# enrichM
The purpose of enrichM is threefold: First, to provide a very basic pipeline for quickly annotating population genomes. Second, to compare user-defined groups of genomes and identify the enrichment of genes or metabolic pathways within and between groups. Third, to construct metabolic networks from the annotated population genomes. enrichM is not restricted to population genomes, and can be used to analyze and integrate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data in metabolic networks. 

enrichM is currently in a state of flux, so I'll update this space when things become more stable.
